â€¦every current economist must be constantly updating approaches on how to best serve a possible customer base and identify how these shifts will affect the economy at large. While the economy will continue to shift, the main principles that are taught in economics classes at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/economics/) are still relevant to the overall economy. This mixture of faced paced dedication and reliance towards proven techniques I believe greatly defines many of my career and personal ambitions.   

As a Senior at CNU, the ambitious nature of business has propelled me to further explore possible career fields, developing early on my passion for microeconomics.
