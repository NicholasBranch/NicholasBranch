â€¦every current economist must be constantly updating approaches on how to best serve a possible customer base and identify how these shifts will affect the economy at large. While the economy will continue to shift, the main principles that are taught by the [Christopher Newport University Economics](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/economics/) department are still relevant to the overall economy. This mixture of fast paced behavior and reliance towards proven techniques greatly defines many of my career and personal ambitions.   

As a Senior at CNU, the ambitious nature of business has propelled me to further explore possible career fields, developing early on my passion for microeconomics. Specifically, I am pursuing the study of the economic effects of modernizing the customer service industry across different markets. 

With many years of experience in the customer service industry, below is a list of all the different locations I have worked in a customer service capacity in the past:
- [Trible Library Media Center](https://cnu.libguides.com/mediacenter)
- [Home Depot (Store# 8551)](https://www.homedepot.com/l/S-Riding/VA/Chantilly/20152/8551)
- [VT IDirect (now ST Engineering IDirect)](https://www.idirect.net/)
- [The Fitness Equation (South Riding)](https://thefitnessequation.com/locations/south-riding/)

Just as I am
