â€¦every current economist must be constantly updating approaches on how to best serve a possible customer base and identify how these shifts will affect the economy at large. While the economy will continue to shift, the main principles that are taught in economics classes at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/economics/) are still relevant to the overall economy. This mixture of fast paced behavior and reliance towards proven techniques greatly defines many of my career and personal ambitions.   

As a Senior at CNU, the ambitious nature of business has propelled me to further explore possible career fields, developing early on my passion for microeconomics. Specifically, I would like to study the economic effects of modernizing the customer service industry across different markets. 

With many years of experience in the customer service industry, below is a list of all the different locations I have worked in a customer service capacity in the past:
- Christopher Newport Media Center
