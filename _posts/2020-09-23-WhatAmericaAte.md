When the norms crumbled like an abandoned home during the Great Depression, the members of both the high and low class were affected in unforeseen ways. One of these unforeseen ways was through the prices at restaurants. As the price for food rises, the restaurant industry reflect those drastic changes. The menus of this era in history provide potential markers for possible economic downturns.  Collections like What America Ate could be used for historical reference purposes but also for educational purposes.

A clean design aesthetic as displayed below brings with it an air of professionalism that spreads throughout the digital humanities project. The simplicity of the menus allow for easy access to desired functions, such as the interactive map for different menus from each region and the search section for returning to a menu that you might have viewed before. Tooling for the website also allows for the visual display on many different devices, which provides more opportunities to share the project with more viewers. This dedication to user interaction is most definitely what brought about the support of the National Endowment of the Humanities, which provides significant funding and oversight for the project. The visual implication of the text is unparalleled in projects that I have seen before.

Each menu can change size and isolated during viewing to allow for complete access to the source material, while a scroll down will provide sources to preview in a smaller and more digestible form. The menus have detailed descriptions and how each items pricing for the particular time in history, helping to provide historical context and intriguing the audience to continue looking at the descriptions of the other sources. A continued focus on exploration underlies the directional menu system and visual display for the continuation of research and learning. While not intended for a younger audience, the relative ease of use and simplistic design would provide an invaluable teaching tool for those wanting to learn more about life during the Great Depression.

While the article does a fantastic job of providing a powerful interactive experience, there are some possible improvements. The minimalism, while easy for digestion for the viewer, does not allow for more information and images that might help to explain the written descriptions. The simple fix for this would be to add more historical references on the page.
Other concerns I had with the project was the inability to join the project through the sign-in. When I tried to access the system, the CAPtcha form did not seem to be working. This could cause major problems down the line if new information were to arise. Hopefully, that could be fixed with a simple update to the project. 

The project seemed well designed for the aesthetics, but the project is not finished completely. Even though the project is very close to completion, continual adaptation is required for the best outcome possible.  I am excited to see the project continue to grow, and have people learn about the economics of The Great Depression.   One more push in the right direction, and the project will be complete.
