   When the American societal norms crumbled like an abandoned home during the Great Depression, the members of both the high and low class were affected in unforeseen ways. One of these unforeseen ways was through the prices at restaurants. As the price for food continued to rise, the restaurant industry began to reflect those drastic changes. The menus of this era in history provide potential markers for possible economic downturns, which is why the collection of them at What America Ate could not only be used for historical reference purposes but also for educational purposes.

A clean design aesthetic as displayed below brings with it an air of professionalism that spreads throughout the digital humanities project.The simplicity of the menus allow for easy access to desired functions, such as the interactive map for different menus from each region and the search section for returning to a menu that you might have viewed before. Tooling for the website also allows for the visual display on many different devices, which provides more opportunities to share the project with more viewers.
 This dedication to user interaction is most definitely what brought about the support of the National Endowment of the Humanities, which provides significant funding and oversight for the project. The visual implication of the text is unparalleled in projects that I have seen.

Each menu is enlarged and isolated during viewing to allow for complete access to the source material, while a scroll down will provide  sources to be previewed in a smaller and more digestible form. The elegant design attached with each menu in the catalog comes with a transcribed version so that viewers can understand the prices and items on each menu. The menus also have detailed descriptions and how each item was priced for the particular time in history, helping to provide historical context and intriguing the audience to continue looking at the descriptions of the other sources. A continued focus on exploration underlies the directional menu system and visual display for the continuation of research and learning. While not intended for a younger audience, the relative ease of use and simplistic design would provide an invaluable teaching tool for those wanting to learn more about life during the Great Depression.

While the article does a fantastic job of providing a powerful interactive experience, there are some possible improvements. The minimalism, while easy for digestion for the viewer, does not allow for the addition of more information and images that might help to explain the written descriptions.
