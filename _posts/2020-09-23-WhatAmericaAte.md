â€¦every current economist must be constantly updating approaches on how to best serve a possible customer base and identify how these shifts will affect the economy at large. While the economy will continue to shift, the main principles that are taught by the [Christopher Newport University Economics](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/economics/) department are still relevant to the overall economy. This mixture of fast paced behavior and reliance towards proven techniques greatly defines my career and personality.   

As a Senior at CNU, the ambitious nature of business has propelled me to further explore possible career fields, developing early on my passion for microeconomics. Specifically, I am pursuing the study of the economic effects of modernizing the customer service industry across different markets. 

With many years of experience in the customer service industry, below is a list of all the different locations I have worked in a customer service capacity in the past:
- [Trible Library Media Center](https://cnu.libguides.com/mediacenter)


- [Home Depot (Store# 8551)](https://www.homedepot.com/l/S-Riding/VA/Chantilly/20152/8551)


- [VT IDirect (now ST Engineering IDirect)](https://www.idirect.net/)


- [The Fitness Equation (South Riding)](https://thefitnessequation.com/locations/south-riding/)

Just as there is a balance within the economics field, my personal life has also embraced that as well. I am actively involved in the Marching Captains, the marching band on campus. This has allowed me oppurtunities to meet interesting people, in fields I had never known existed, until joining the band. While I am engaged with the Marching Captains and being a student at CNU, one of the most relaxing parts of my day is returning to my Russian tortoise Spike.

While Spike is not your average pet, my little buddy and I have had many adventures. If you would like to hear more about my work in Economics or just want to learn more about the adventures of Spike, my email is nicholas dot branch dot seventeen at CNU dot edu or you can follow me on Twitter [@NBranch1005](https://twitter.com/NBranch1005).
