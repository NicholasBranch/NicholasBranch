# While humanity continues to progress into the digital age...

...the importance of the digitalization of the traditional humanities has not been lost. With that comes essential tools, like Oxygen, that can easily translate these texts into a digital environment. Oxygen is a closed source, independent data editing and manipulation software, that allows for the user to manipulate code to accurately represent their historical source. With an easy to use interface and preconceived notion of how to project was to pan out, Oxygen provided a detailed and user-friendly experience when working on the TEI project of digitizing “The Yellow Wall-Paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson.

As shown above, almost the entirety of the coding portion project were the tags that we learned during lecture, which allowed me to do a deeper dive into the different styles used for those tags, that I will later be able to adapt into future projects. An example of this would be how individual tags were created within the body of the article, which can simply be named directly in the article itself. The repetitive use of the paragraph tag brought with it the opportunity to find other ways to repeat the same process, which could be possible future Oxygen improvement in the making. While the source initially allowed for a little bit of experimentation, most of my experimentation of XML and Oxygen was outside the confines of the project.

The adapted version of the source material provided few challenges, with one specifically that caused a second glance at the source. In the adaptation, the word furniture is misspelled as "fnrniture", which I had to fix using the misspelling tag. This was the closest example of editing that I noticed when researching about the commands of XML, which fit the projects since the historical context should be withheld.
