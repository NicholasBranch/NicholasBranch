# While humanity continues to progress into the digital age...

...the importance of the digitalization of the traditional humanities has not been lost. With that comes essential tools, like Oxygen, that can easily translate these texts into a digital environment. Oxygen is a closed source, independent data editing and manipulation software, that allows for the user to manipulate code to accurately represent their historical source. With an easy to use interface and preconceived notion of how to project was to pan out, Oxygen provided a pleasant experience when working on the TEI project. 

As shown above, almost the entirety of the coding portion project were the tags that we learned during lecture. This allowed me to do a deeper dive into the different styles used for those tags, which I will later be able to adapt into future projects. An example of this would be how individual tags were created within the body of the article, which can simply be named directly in the article itself.
