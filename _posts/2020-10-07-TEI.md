# Beginning with the Project...

Just as there is a balance within the economics field, my personal life has also embraced that as well. I am actively involved in the Marching Captains, the marching band on campus. This has allowed me oppurtunities to meet interesting people, in fields I had never known existed, until joining the band. While I am engaged with the Marching Captains and being a student at CNU, one of the most relaxing parts of my day is returning to my Russian tortoise Spike.
