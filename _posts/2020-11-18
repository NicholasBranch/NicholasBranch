With that comes essential tools, like Oxygen, that can easily translate these texts into a digital environment. Oxygen is a closed source, independent data editing software, that allows for the user to manipulate code to accurately represent their historical source. Oxygen is essential to the development of the digital age within the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). With an easy to use interface and preconceived notion of how the project was to pan out, Oxygen provided a detailed and user-friendly experience when working on the TEI project of digitizing “The Yellow Wall-Paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson.

The enlightening perspective of the “The Yellow Wall-Paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson is seen throughout many mediums, so the transition from article to digital media was a necessary step in the evolution of the piece. The seemingly slow turning to madness with misogynistic undertones brings about more discussions of the struggles of the modern women, and helps to identify the misconceptions of the past. This elegant source of historical literature provided an easy task for digitization into the revised media.

As shown above, almost the entirety of the coding portion project were the tags that we learned during lecture, which allowed me to do a deeper dive into the different styles used for those tags, that I will later be able to adapt into future projects. An example of this would be how individual tags were created within the body of the article, which can simply be named directly in the article itself. The repetitive use of the paragraph tag brought with it the opportunity to find other ways to repeat the same process automatically, which could be possible future Oxygen improvement for the software. While the source initially allowed for only a small amount of experimentation, most of my experimentation of XML and Oxygen was outside the confines of the initial project of digitizing TYWP.

The initial step of creating a google document to identify the steps recommended for this phase was of great advantage, and I would suggest if you were to do it again that this step was imperative. The ability to adapt the coding on the fly would be greatly challenging, and would need much more skill than required.

The adapted version of the source material provided few challenges, with one specifically that caused a second glance at the source as shown above. In the adaptation, the word furniture is misspelled as "fnrniture", which I had to fix using the misspelling tag. This was the closest example of editing that I noticed when researching about the commands of XML, which fit the projects since the historical context should be withheld. The menus that were used to sort through the different options had pop up windows, allowing for those who had never used the tool to understand each option. Overall, the simplicity of the coding that was required for this project was accurately depicted as an undertaking that anyone, even someone without computer science knowledge, could easily complete.
