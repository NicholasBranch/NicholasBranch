# Crocs Clogs are the footwear that defies fashion...

...because of  its relative explosion on to the footwear scene, the physical appearance of the clog themselves, and its ability to interject itself into the mainstream fashion icons. Crocs Clogs are known worldwide for not only for how unconventional they are and how comfortable they are to wear. This brings with it a somewhat cult following of fans ranging from the fashion enthusiasts who want to be different to someone who needs affordable footwear without the backstory. Crocs clogs has been an iconic silhouette since its launch in 2001 and has seen many resurgences, providing invaluable support for many different subcultures in the fashion world. 

  Considering this, you would think that finding articles connecting this icon set of footwear to the wide world of fashion would be simple. Unfortunately, finding cult classics that could match the Clog in historical context and persistent remodelings was extremely difficult to find. Most of my information for the crocs clog has come directly from the Crocs Press release page pictured below, and that is obviously biased toward their own product. No other piece of footwear that I could find could match the Crocs Clog in cultural significance for both the era of its release and now, with a focus on comfort being the forefront of the design to this day.

  While I struggled with other styles of recognizable footwear, the fashion industry as a whole has many different examples of styles that have withstanded the tests of time being collected and reviewed for a newer audience. For example, many japanese fashion brands have created models for me to use when designing the project. Specifically the Uniqlo brand has had a similar explosion in the culture with the significant focus on function with lots of different scholarly reviews on their flagship products. While these two brands are very different, these giants of comfort in the current era can both be integral to my project.
