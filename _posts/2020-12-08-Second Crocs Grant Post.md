#  As the project proposal comes closer to being due...
  
  
  this is a perfect opportunity to review the different aspects of the project for the next class that attends this course. While there were many different facets of the project that were enlightening to complete, the nature of the project I have selected made the process more complex than most. As the project begins to come to a close, the best way to create a positive experience for future students is to identify possible stumbling blocks. 

  With my project, the fashion industry is so wide and commercialized, I seemed to run into a paywall for information regularly. While this was not an ideal for a project with relatively small overhead, the most influential informant was the Crocs website which is free, which helped significantly. I was able to bring together enough free information for the project, but the constant battle against the paywall could have been avoided. 

  Another issue I had with my specific topic for the project was the inability to find specific examples of other projects that could be express models for the project. While this might be the first time Crocs Clogs have been used in a historical context, I was surprised to find little information of that nature provided for the public. While there were plenty of museum and art collections, many were not considered DH projects because there was no interpretation of articles. 

  These were the two main issues that occurred during the project, but there were many different positive aspects to the project. The organization of different steps of the project were very helpful in planning out the due dates. I was able to gauge the amount of time required for each part of the project, and then buckle down before it was time to meet the peer reviews. This provided markers for how close I was with my classmates, in case I need assistance and thought they could assist. The organization of the class was essential to my completion of the project, and hopefully this can continue through to the next class.

  Another positive aspect of the project was the peer review process. While they provided markers for the progression of the project, the best part of the peer review process in my opinion was specifically the feedback. I have struggled with translating my writing into a clear and concise format for blog writing, and through the different peer reviews I believe I have become closer than ever before. With every different personâ€™s writing that I reviewed and a new person that reviewed my work, I understood more and more the focus on the reader's perception. Hopefully, that has translated into this blog post.  

  Finally, it was good to have a project that I was somewhat passionate about. In my other courses, there is a focus on completing projects solely for completion. I enjoyed going outside of this structured thought and started creating something for the possibility of creating something new. I only wish more classes were able to combine this technique.  
  
  In conclusion, while this project has definitely had its ups and downs, my quality of writing has improved, the style of writing has become more manageable, and I believe have discussed an interesting topic with potential to be used for an actual digital humanities project.
